# Yeet me into space

What is this? (The title pretty much sums it up.) Yeet yourself into space. :rocket: (I built this at Los Altos Hacks V to learn Framer Motion.)

## Built with

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- framer-motion
- react-icons
- Twemoji

## Inspiration

I just woke up one day and dumped my brain into this repo, and this is what happened.

## Set up locally

1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/exu3/yeet.git`
2. Do `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Then `npm run dev` to run the site locally at `localhost:3000`

:v: :rocket: :moon:
